This tool returns the user a feasible sudoku solution (if it is one).

The solver has three types of solutions approach which can be configured on config.json file.

- Brute force algorithm [DONE]
- Linear Programming Optimization [TODO]
- AI resolution [TODO]

Finally, how the different approaches were built and the results obtained are widely explained on my Medium page:

### TODOs:

* Create docstings
* Reduce cognitive complexity from BruteForceSolver
* Refine Sudoku ResolutionLog
* Solve sudoku with a LP problem
* Solve sudoku with a AI
* Compare different approaches
* Create UI
